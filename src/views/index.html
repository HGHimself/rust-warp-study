            <h6>What is the Digitheque?</h6>
            <p>The name digitheque comes from a portmanteau of the words <i>digital</i> and <i>bibliotheque</i>.
                We are trying to develop a different type of search engine for resources and tools on the internet.
                Traditional search engines like Google are more direct, having the user query what their are looking
                for.
            </p>
            <p>The Digitheque is fundamentally different. Users build up groups of bookmarks to sites they are
                interested in. From there, the user can explore outward and see what other users have bookmarked the
                same
                sites. The group of bookmarks is important because it is a node of the network. Two matching bookmarks
                are what links
                these groups together.

            <h6>Why make another social network?</h6>
            <p>It is apparent that people are upset with the state of the internet. Siloed,
                proprietary platforms that push to maximize engagement are central to corporate monetization
                strategies. These proprietary platforms are also directly in competition with the
                core principles of the internet. In order to do my part in the fight against the monopolization
                of the internet (as well as people's attention), we have developed the Digitheque.

            <h6>What do we do different?</h6>
            <p>Well the core driver of the network is exploration. The Digitheque is unlike a
                traditional social media network where the driver is interaction.</p>

            <h6>How do I use it?</h6>
            <p>The app is designed to be as easy as possible to use. There are two main concepts: the Link and the Page.
                A user can have many pages. A page can have at most 10 links. If you and another user have a page with
                the
                same link, you can see their page.
                That is it; no comments, no statuses, you will not even be able to see who owns that page.
            </p>
